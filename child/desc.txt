Childhood Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening using Machine Learning

The early diagnosis of neurodevelopment disorders can improve treatment and significantly decrease the associated 
healthcare costs. In this project, we will use supervised learning to diagnose Autistic Spectrum Disorder 
(ASD) based on behavioural features and individual characteristics. More specifically, we will build and deploy a neural network using the Keras API. 

This project will use a dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains screening data for 292 patients. The dataset can be found at the following URL:

We'll be using the "Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Child " public dataset from the 



Abstract:
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment  condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and
early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. Unfortunately, waiting times for an ASD diagnosis are lengthy and
procedures are not cost effective. The economic impact of autism and the increase in the number of ASD cases across
the world reveals an urgent need for the development of easily implemented and effective screening methods. 
Therefore, a time-efficient and accessible ASD screening is imminent to help health professionals and inform individuals 
whether they should pursue formal clinical diagnosis.  
The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits.
However, such datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, 
very limited autism datasets associated with clinical or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. 
Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism screening of adults that contained 20 features to be utilised for
further analysis especially in determining influential autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases.
In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features (AQ-10-Adult) plus ten individuals characteristics that have proved to be 
effective in detecting the ASD cases from controls in behaviour science. 

Road Map:

* [Step 0]Import Datasets.

* [Step 1] Clean Datasets (The data needs to be cleaned; many rows contain missing data, 
and there may be erroneous data identifiable as outliers).

* [Step 2] A quick visualization with *Seaborn*.

* [Step 3] At First, I applied several Supervised Machine Learning (SML) techniques on the data 
for classification purpose.

* [Step 4] Next, I experimented with different topologies, optimizers, and hyperparameters for different models.

* [Step 5] Model tuning.

* [Step 6] Feature Selection.

* [Step 7]Then I built a Multi-Layer Perceptron and train it to classify indivisual with ASD based on its features.

* [Step 8] Conclusion.
